# Task_Road_Polygon

This is a Lane Detection CNN model to identify lane for autonomous vehicles and for traffic management system(in-progress).

# CNN
This python notebook uses CNN model to learn the training dataset with cross_validation dataset.
Then this model is tested on a test video which hangs from a pole. Although this model is not ideal
for a pole camera as road turns out to be at different angle and due to lack of dataset and space constraints
in my machine. I couldn't download 11.Gb of data. Hence I have worked on 450 mb of dataset.

No Pretrained model is used in this project.

The code is written in python using google colab note books. Therefore the filename or filepath you will see
in my code are mounted from my google drive account.
